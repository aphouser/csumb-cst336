                <p>I've done a little bit of work with Android Studio, and I had
                a blast!  I loved the way the design was both visual and text-based.  
                If you've got some desire to do some mobile development, take a look here.</p>

                <h3>Java could be useful</h3>
                <p>Java is the primary language for Android development.  Java is also a 
                general purpose language that is used all over the world.  <a href="https://www.zipcodewilmington.com/blog/5-reasons-why-you-need-to-learn-java-programming">Some</a> say it is 
                the most commonly used programming language.  So, you could get a 
                two for one here and learn the language for Android development PLUS 
                get some good knowledge for programming in the world in general.</p>

                <h3>Swift is another option</h3>
                <p>If Apple is more your style, Swift is where you want to look.  <a href="https://www.apple.com/everyone-can-code/">Apple 
                has the stance that they designed Swift for everyone and it is easy to use.</a>  
                It is hard to argue with the popularity of either brand of mobile 
                OS these days, so you'd probably do just fine with either one if the mobile platform ticles your fancy.</p>
